.SH NAME
planet \- print phase of the Moon and planetary information, precess data
in .star file format.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplanet [juliandate]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program generate and maintain star chart data in the format used by
the \fBstarchart\fR software tools.
.PP
Planetary information is generated by the program \fBplanet\fR, which calculates
locations a given Julian date, or for the current time (given no arguments).
In common use, an alternate syntax is provided to simplify the calculation of
the Julian date, in which integers for month, day, (mandatory), and year are
given. Time is specified in the form \fBhh.mm\fP or \fBhh\fP on a 24-hour clock
and defaults to 0.00 (midnight). The \fB-z\fP flag (same format as -t) gives
the number of hours the observer is west of GMT (see below).
.PP
A summary is then printed on the standard output giving the right ascension,
declination and distance (in AU's) for the Sun and all planets except Pluto.
This data is additionally placed in the file \fBplanet.star\fR for subsequent
use by charting software.
.SH BUGS
Daylight savings time may have to be reckoned for in \fBplanet\fP, as the
default \fB-z\fP value during periods of daylight time may or may not be
adjusted relative to GMT. The required code changes would make \fBplanet\fP
installation dependent.
