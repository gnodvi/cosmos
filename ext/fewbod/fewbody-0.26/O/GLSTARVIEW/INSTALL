Just type "make" on a GNU system, or "gmake" on a non-GNU system.  Note
that you will need to have GL, GLU, and glut (and their corresponding
development packages) installed first.  These packages come with most modern
Linux distributions.  Try www.rpmfind.net if you can't find them.  Instructions
for other unices are welcome.

Doing "make install" will install the executable in $HOME/bin; "make 
uninstall" will uninstall it.

3D acceleration is usually not necessary unless you have a really slow CPU, or
want to render at really high resolution.

Mac OS X users will have to install not only glut, but also gnugetopt.  I 
recommend using Fink for this.
